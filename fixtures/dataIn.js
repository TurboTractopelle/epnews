Martingale theory for housekeeping heat


Which universal thermodynamic properties emerge in a nonequilibrium process, in isothermal conditions at temperature T, that result from the violation of detailed balance, and how they may be quantified? The housekeeping heat is the fluctuating heat exchanged between a mesoscopic system and its environment due to the violation of detailed balance. Using the framework of martingale theory widely used in probability theory and finance, we derive a number of universal equalities and inequalities for extreme-value and stopping-time statistics of the housekeeping heat. Our theory provides a quantitative link between minimal models of gambling and financial markets (martingales) and heat fluctuations.  The housekeeping heat behaves like a gambler’s fortune in a casino: its expected value in the future is always smaller or equal regardless of its past values. The super-martingale structure of the housekeeping heat implies that certain statistical properties of the housekeeping heat are system-independent, i.e. universal. A particular result of our theory is that the average value of the maximum housekeeping heat that a system absorbs from its environment cannot exceed kBT, with kB Boltzmann’s constant.

Intelligent metamaterials behave like electrostatic chameleons


Metashells can adapt their wave-bending behaviour based on the characteristics of the material they contain

A chameleon can flexibly change its colour to match its surroundings. And a similar phenomenon can now be seen in a new class of smart materials called metamaterials. The trouble is that these metamaterials lack the ability to respond to nearby objects due to their physical characteristics. To remedy this shortcoming, the authors have developed so-called 'metashells': hollow shells made of metamaterials and capable of carrying materials in their core. The advantage is that their physical characteristics, such as permittivity--the extent to which a material can store charge within an electrical field--change with the electromagnetic properties of the material they contain. In a theoretical study published recently, they describe how they have developed an entire class of these chameleon-like metashells. These intelligent metashells could become an all-purpose material to satisfy different permittivity requirements under different conditions. The next stages will focus on experimental research, and on industrial applications.
